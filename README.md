* Create notes with **title**, **plain body text**, and an **optional photo**.
* Automatic **geotagging** (latitude/longitude) with **reverse‑geocoded address**.
* List, view, edit, and delete notes.
* **Local persistence** via SQLite; works offline.
* Minimal, clean UI styled with Tailwind‑like utilities (NativeWind).

```

## Releases & Downloads

Prebuilt artifacts are published on the **GitHub Releases** page. For convenience, a signed **APK** is attached to each tagged release so you can install the app on Android without the Play Store.

* Stable builds: *link auto‑generated by GitHub upon release*
* Attached assets: `app-release.apk` (direct install)

## Architecture Overview

* **App shell & navigation:** Expo Router (file‑system based routing)
* **Data layer:** SQLite (Expo SDK) with a thin repository in `lib/db.ts`
* **Device capabilities:** Camera (image capture) & Media Library (image pick), Location (GPS + reverse geocoding)
* **Presentation:** Functional RN components, NativeWind utility classes
* **Testing:** Unit tests with Vitest

## Requirements

* **Node.js** ≥ 20
* **npm**
* Android device with **Expo Go** *or* an **Android emulator**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/begiedz/geo-notes.git
cd geo-notes

# 2) Install deps
npm install

# 3) Start the dev server (Metro)
npm run start
# Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or press "a" to launch an Android emulator.
```

## Development

Common commands:

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run start

# Launch directly to Android emulator
npx expo start --android
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test
```

## Building (APK)

This project uses **EAS Build** to produce an installable **APK** for quick testing and releases.

```bash
# Produces an APK suitable for direct install on devices
npx eas build -p android --profile preview
```

The resulting APK is ideal for testers and will be attached to **GitHub Releases** for convenience.

## Runtime Permissions

The app requests the following at runtime:

* **Camera / Media Library** – to capture or pick a photo for a note.
* **Location** – to attach GPS coordinates and resolve an address.

If a permission is denied, the corresponding feature will be degraded (e.g., notes without photos or location).
